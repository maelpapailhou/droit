A civil case begins with a plaintiff. He or she has a complaint about the actions of another person or organization. The plaintiff files the complaint with a court.

The person or organization accused of a wrongdoing is the defendant. Both the plaintiff and the defendant usually have attorneys. The attorneys speak on behalf of their clients. A paralegal, a person with legal training, may assist the attorney.

In some cases, a jury listens to arguments for and against the defendant. Then they decide on a verdict.

Finally, the judge makes a decision to resolve the complaint.

**Verdict** - a legal conclusion

**Legal system** - the methods of interpreting laws and putting them into effect

**Court** - the place where people go to conduct legal business

**Complaint** - a written document that states the reason for legal action

**Paralegal** - an attorney's assistant with specialized legal training

**Plaintiff** - a person who accuses another person of a wrongdoing

**Civil** - occurring between citizens.

The judge listened to the attorneys arguments.

The jury decided that the man was not guilty.

The defendant hired an attorney to prove that he was innocent.

Attorney: What is the possible outcome of the case?
