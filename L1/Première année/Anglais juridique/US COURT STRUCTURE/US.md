District courts - These are general courts. But in some cases, the jurisdiction is passed to specialized courts.

These include: bankruptcy courts, tax courts and the court of private land claims.

Court of Appeals - The Court of Appeals reviews all decisions in the lower courts that people object to.

State courts - These courts decide disputes that pertain to state laws rather than federal laws.

The Supreme Court - This is another appeals court, but it is the only court that operates under discretionary review.

This means it can choose which cases to hear. The Supreme Court is also called a High Court in some countries.

Student A: Hi, I'm a client, and I'm not sure which court my case will be in. Is my case going to the state or federal courts?

Student B: Well, it depends on the nature of your case. If it involves federal law, it will likely be in a federal court, but if it's a state law issue, it will be in a state court.

Student A: What are my options if the court rules against me?

Student B: If the court rules against you, you can appeal the decision to a higher court, which will review the case and make a new decision.

Student A: What's the likelihood of having my case reviewed?

Student B: It's hard to say. Generally, the chances of a successful appeal depend on the strength of your case and the grounds for the appeal. But it's always worth considering your options and discussing them with me. We can ask for the case to be reviewed if we believe there are valid reasons for doing so.
