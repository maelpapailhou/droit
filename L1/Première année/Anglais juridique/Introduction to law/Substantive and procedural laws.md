1.  How do substantive and procedural laws differ?

-   Substantive law defines the legal relationship between individuals or entities and the state or government. It sets out the rights and duties of individuals and entities, and specifies the consequences of certain actions. Procedural law, on the other hand, establishes the rules and processes that govern the enforcement of substantive law. It sets out the procedures for how legal cases are handled and the rights of the parties involved in the legal process.

2.  Compare civil cases and criminal cases in respect of the following criteria:

-   Purpose of the law in the cases: Civil cases involve disputes between private parties, such as individuals or companies, and the purpose of the law is to provide a remedy for the harm caused by one party to the other. Criminal cases, on the other hand, involve crimes committed against society as a whole, and the purpose of the law is to punish the offender and protect society.
-   Parties in the cases: Civil cases involve private parties as the plaintiff and defendant, whereas criminal cases involve the state or government as the prosecutor and the accused as the defendant.
-   Persons making the decision in the cases: In civil cases, the decision is usually made by a judge or a jury, whereas in criminal cases, the decision is made by a judge or a jury, based on the evidence presented by the prosecutor and the defense attorney.
-   The most usual remedies and penalties imposed by the court: In civil cases, the most usual remedy is monetary compensation or damages, whereas in criminal cases, the most usual penalty is imprisonment, fines, or community service.
