## Common law
**What is the primary source of law in the common law system?**

Answer: The primary source of law in the common law system is *case law*, which is made through the decisions of judges in individual cases.

**What countries have adopted common law? Why are most of them called Commonwealth countries?**

Answer: Countries that have adopted common law include the United States, Canada, England, Australia, New Zealand, and India, among others. Most of these countries are called Commonwealth countries because they were formerly part of the British Empire.

**How did common law develop?**

Answer: Common law developed in England during the Middle Ages, as a body of law that was created through the decisions of judges in individual cases. Over time, this system of case law developed into a coherent legal system that was used throughout England and later adopted in other countries.

**What is the doctrine of precedent and how is it applied in common law?**

Answer: The doctrine of precedent, also known as stare decisis, is a legal principle that requires lower courts to follow the decisions of higher courts in similar cases. This means that a court must follow the legal principles established by previous court decisions, or precedents, unless there is a compelling reason to depart from them.

**How does the doctrine of precedent operate within the judicial system in common law countries?**

Answer: In common law countries, the doctrine of precedent operates within the judicial system by creating a hierarchy of courts, with higher courts able to overrule decisions made by lower courts. This allows legal principles to be developed and refined over time, based on the decisions of judges in individual cases. The doctrine of precedent also ensures consistency and predictability in the application of the law, as courts are bound to follow established precedents unless there is a compelling reason to depart from them.

## Continental law
**What is the primary source of law in the continental law system?**

Answer: The primary source of law in the continental law system is written law, which is created through legislation and codification by legislative bodies.

**What countries have adopted continental law?**

Answer: Countries that have adopted continental law include France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and many other European countries, as well as countries in Latin America and Africa that were colonized by European powers.

**How did continental law develop?**

Answer: Continental law developed in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, as a response to the fragmentation and complexity of the legal systems that existed at the time. Legal scholars and lawmakers sought to create a more unified and rational legal system, based on written law and codification.

**What are the main features of continental law?**

Answer: The main features of continental law include a focus on written law and codification, a civil law system that relies on codes and statutes rather than case law, a more centralized and hierarchical legal system, and a greater emphasis on legal certainty and predictability.

**What ideas influenced the development of codification in continental law countries?**

Answer: The development of codification in continental law countries was influenced by the Enlightenment, which emphasized reason, rationality, and the rule of law. Legal scholars and lawmakers sought to create a more rational and systematic legal system, based on written law and codification, which would promote legal certainty and predictability. The Napoleonic Code, which was created in France in 1804, was a major influence on the development of codification in continental law countries, and served as a model for many other countries as they developed their own legal codes.

## Common Law vs. Continental Law Systems:

**Development:** Common law: Developed in England during the Middle Ages, based on the decisions of judges in individual cases. Continental law: Developed in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries, as a response to the complexity and fragmentation of existing legal systems.

**Methodological approach to sources of law:** Common law: Relies primarily on case law, which is created through the decisions of judges in individual cases. Continental law: Relies primarily on written law, which is created through legislation and codification by legislative bodies.

**Formulation of legal opinions:** Common law: Legal opinions are typically based on precedents established by previous court decisions, which are interpreted and applied to the facts of the case at hand. Continental law: Legal opinions are typically based on the interpretation and application of written law, as codified in statutes and codes.

**Application of the principle of the separation of powers:** Common law: Applies the principle of the separation of powers, with the judiciary serving as an independent branch of government. Continental law: Also applies the principle of the separation of powers, but typically places a greater emphasis on the role of the executive and legislative branches.

**Training of judges:** Common law: Judges are typically appointed based on their legal qualifications and experience, with many coming from the legal profession. Continental law: Judges are typically trained through a specialized educational system, and are often required to have a degree in law or a related field.

**Systems of adjudication (inquisitorial and adversarial):** Common law: Adversarial system, where the parties in a case present their arguments and evidence to a neutral judge or jury, who then make a decision based on the evidence presented. Continental law: Inquisitorial system, where the judge plays a more active role in investigating the facts of the case and directing the proceedings.
