I met with a colleague today to discuss a case involving Great Cars Incorporated. The company is currently facing a lawsuit for not following proper brake testing procedures, which resulted in a driver getting into an accident. The driver is now suing the company for $1 million.

During our conversation, my colleague mentioned that there is a precedent from a previous lawsuit against Car Masters that could potentially help our case. However, there is concern that the opposing side might argue that the plaintiff did not meet seatbelt requirements, similar to what happened in the Car Masters case.

Nonetheless, my colleague believes that we have a good chance of winning the case and is optimistic about our chances. We will need to carefully consider all the causes and precedents before making any decisions.
