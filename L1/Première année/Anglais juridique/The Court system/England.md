The judicial system is full of traditions and protocol. If you are to appear in court, it's good to know the basics.

Before the judge enters the room, the clerk says 'All rise. At this point, everyone stands up.

You are sworn in by the clerk.

Don't lie when you are under oath. The result is being charged with perjury.

Speak to the judge clearly and don't interrupt. Always address the judge as 'Your Honor.

You cannot approach the bench. Only lawyers are allowed to enter 'the well'. Then they talk to the judge off the record.

2.  People can find information on court etiquette through various sources, such as court websites, legal resources, or by consulting with an attorney.

There are a large number of protocols when appearing in court. For example, when the clerk says "all rise", everyone stands up. After being sworn in, a person is then under oath. If a person lies under oath, he or she risks being charged with perjury. There are also rules for addressing the judge.

Student A: Your Honor, may I speak with you about a witness? Student B: Of course, what is the issue with the witness? Student A: Your Honor, the witness seems to be changing her story even though the evidence clearly contradicts her previous statements. Student B: That's a serious charge. Do you have any evidence to support your claim? Student A: Yes, Your Honor. We have recordings of her previous statements and the inconsistencies in her current testimony.
