There are two types of lawyer practising in England. Last year I finished my training contract and I started working for a large international law firm. I am now a qualified lawyer. Many solicitors work together in partnerships but barristers don't. Only barristers can speak on behalf of clients in court is not a true statement in the UK. In the UK, both barristers and solicitors can represent clients in court. In the UK, lawyers cannot take a special exam to be a judge.
