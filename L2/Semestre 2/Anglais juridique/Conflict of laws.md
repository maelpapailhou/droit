Conflict of laws happens when two countries have different legal rules about the same situation. This can create serious problems, especially in areas like marriage, divorce, and family matters. A common example is polygamous marriage. In countries like Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, a man can legally have multiple wives. However, if he moves to France, where polygamy is illegal, only his first wife will be recognized as legally married. The second or third wives will not have any legal status, which can cause problems with visas, inheritance, or property rights. This situation can also create difficulties for the children of these marriages, as their legal status may be uncertain in a country that does not recognize polygamy.

Another example is divorce laws, which vary widely from one country to another. In some countries, such as Egypt or Pakistan, a man can divorce his wife simply by saying "talaq" three times. This is called triple talaq and is a form of Islamic divorce. However, if the couple moves to the UK or Canada, the local courts may not recognize this type of divorce because it does not involve legal procedures or mutual consent. As a result, a woman who believes she is divorced in her home country may still be considered legally married in another country, which can cause problems if she wants to remarry. Similarly, a couple that divorces legally in one country may not have their divorce recognized in another, leading to complications in cases of remarriage, child custody, or division of property.

**Another major issue is same-sex marriage. In many Western countries, such as Spain, Canada, and the Netherlands, same-sex couples can get married and have the same legal rights as heterosexual couples. However, if a same-sex couple moves to a country where same-sex marriage is illegal, such as Russia or Saudi Arabia, their marriage may not be recognized at all. This can create difficulties for matters such as inheritance, tax benefits, and medical decisions, where only legal spouses are allowed to make important choices. Some countries even criminalize same-sex relationships, which can put couples at risk simply because their marriage is not recognized.**

Inheritance laws also create conflicts between different legal systems. In some Muslim countries, inheritance follows Islamic law, which means that sons inherit more than daughters. However, in countries like France or Germany, the law requires that all children receive equal shares of an inheritance. If a family that followed Islamic inheritance law moves to a European country, the local courts may refuse to enforce the unequal division of property. This can create tensions within families and legal battles over estates, as courts must decide which legal system to apply.

 Another important example of conflict of laws is surrogacy (GPA, or gestation pour autrui). In some countries, such as the United States (in certain states) and Ukraine, surrogacy is legal, and intended parents can have a child through a surrogate mother. However, in countries like France, Germany, and Spain, surrogacy is illegal, and the courts may refuse to recognize the parental rights of the intended parents. This can create serious difficulties when a couple who used a surrogate abroad tries to register the child as their own in a country where surrogacy is prohibited. In some cases, the child may be left in legal uncertainty, without nationality or official parents, because the birth certificate from the country where the surrogacy took place is not recognized. This raises ethical and legal debates about the rights of the child, the surrogate mother, and the intended parents. As international travel and medical advances continue to grow, conflicts of law in cases of surrogacy remain a major challenge for many families around the world.
