The French Fifth Republic was created in 1958 after a period of political instability during the Fourth Republic. It was designed by Charles de Gaulle and his close collaborators to provide a strong executive power while maintaining democratic principles. The Fifth Republic is based on a semi-presidential system, combining elements of both presidential and parliamentary structures.

The President of the Republic is the most important figure in the system and has significant powers. He is directly elected by the people for a five-year term (since 2002) and serves as the head of state, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and the main actor in foreign policy. The President appoints the Prime Minister, leads the Council of Ministers, and can dissolve the National Assembly. Article 16 of the Constitution also gives him emergency powers, allowing him to take full control in times of crisis. He can also bypass Parliament through referenda and the use of ordinances, reinforcing his authority. Some critics argue that these broad powers create a system of "hyper-presidentialism," where the President dominates political life and reduces the Prime Minister to a secondary role in normal circumstances.

Unlike in purely presidential systems, the Prime Minister leads the government and is responsible to the National Assembly. However, his influence depends on the political situation. During periods of _cohabitation_—when the President and the parliamentary majority belong to different political parties—the Prime Minister gains more power and manages domestic policy. Still, the President usually keeps control over key matters like defense and foreign affairs, showing an imbalance between the two executive roles.

The French Parliament consists of two chambers: the National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly, directly elected by the people, has the main legislative power and can remove the government through a vote of no confidence. The Senate, elected indirectly, plays a more advisory and reviewing role, representing local authorities. However, many experts believe that the executive, especially the President, has too much influence over the legislative branch.

The Constitutional Council ensures that laws follow the Constitution. The judiciary is independent but follows the civil law tradition, different from the common law system. The Constitutional Council acts as a check on the legislative power, but it does not strongly limit the President’s ability to govern through executive actions.

While France has a semi-presidential system, the United Kingdom has a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy. The UK Prime Minister, chosen from the majority party in the House of Commons, has executive power, while the monarch has only a symbolic role. Unlike the French President, who has significant power, the British Prime Minister is directly accountable to Parliament and can be removed easily through a vote of no confidence.

In addition, the UK’s Parliament is sovereign, meaning it has the highest authority and is not limited by a constitutional court like in France. In contrast, the French system includes constitutional limits to protect fundamental rights and separation of powers. However, in reality, the President’s power can sometimes reduce the effectiveness of these checks, leading to criticisms of an overly centralized executive.

In conclusion, both France and the UK have democratic systems, but they function differently. The French Fifth Republic emphasizes strong executive leadership, but some argue that it gives too much power to the President. The UK, on the other hand, focuses on parliamentary sovereignty, making the executive more dependent on the legislative branch.
