**What are the dangers of absolute power?**
An absolute power means that every branches of govt (exec, legis and judis) are between one hand.

Having an absolute power means there wouldn't be the C&B system anymore, and therefore the branches would not control each other anymore. Consequently, there is a risk of passing unconstitutional laws, abandoning fundamental rights, having a dictatorship, with a president remaining in power in eternity, or getting into office without election, override judicial decisions, , declaring war without the approval of Congress.
